# MEDIUM MEMBER PREVIEW BLOCKER

## WHAT IS IT?

An extension for google chrome that removes all member preview posts from https://www.medium.com website.

It's still a work in progress, so expect to find bugs. Don't forget to open an issue when you find one!

## WHY?

Because member preview is getting annoying, when I open medium almost all posts that are presented for me are member preview posts, screw that. I understand that Medium wants to sell their product but this is ruining the plataform, I really hope that Medium reconsider the member preview posts rate, until then I'll keep using this extension.

## HOW TO INSTALL

You need to be using chrome browser, then install the extension clicking [COMING SOON].
